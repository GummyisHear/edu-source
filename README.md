# edu-source
Skilly's Educational source, upgraded by Schmutz. Using it to educate myself and become a full pserver dev lol
I've never coded for pservers before, except making dungeons. I do simple tasks first and will slowly move to harder ones.

Features I've implemented so far:
- [x] Make Guild Name show up in chat before player name
- [x] Add Evasion for Players
- [ ] Add Evasion for Enemies
- [ ] ...


I got the source code from here:
